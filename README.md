# hilton_dl_curriculum
Solutions to exercises in Jacob Hilton's [deep learning curriculum](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum),
which focuses on some of the latest developments in deep learning, especially as they relate to LLM alignment.

The structure of this repository was borrowed from the [Lightning-Hydra-Template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template)
repo; it's usefuleness is in its ability, by combining Lightning and Hydra frameworks, to abstract away annoying
boilerplate and compose hierarchical configurations to quickly, flexibly, and efficiently prototype new models and run
different experiments.  I think this structure will help immensely when it comes to using hydra's optuna plugin to run
multiruns for experimentation, e.g. in Chapter 2 ("Scaling Laws").

This repo is a work in progress, and I'll be updating this document as I complete more of the exercises in each chapter.
